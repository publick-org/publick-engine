"""Turn posted agendas and minutes into readable text and plain-English summaries.

The city posts these as scanned images, which screen readers cannot read.
For each saved PDF, a language model transcribes the full text and writes a
short neutral summary: a preview for an agenda, a record of decisions for
minutes. Results are cached by the PDF's SHA-256 hash in data/summaries/, so
an unchanged document is never processed twice.

Needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY. Without it, the step is skipped.
